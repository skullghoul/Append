# Append
Alright now that you have appending one element down lets append a lot of data to our page. In index.js there is an array of store item objects. We want to put all the information in our #appendToMe div. Go ahead and loop through the array of objects. We are going to put the data in a paragraph tag ex. `<p>name: $price</p>` This is exactly how you should display the information for each item. If the item is in stock give the paragraph tag the class of 'inStock'. If it is not in stock then give the paragraph tag the class of 'notInStock' and add 'Not in stock' after the price ex. `<p>name: $price Not in stock</p>`. Once complete submit this assignment.
